QuickSort

QuickSort
Implement Quicksort and answer the following questions.
(1) How many comparisons will Quicksort do on a list of n elements that all have the same value?
(2) What are the maximum and minimum number of comparisons will Quicksort do on a list of n elements, give an instance for maximum and minimum case respectively.
SearchTwoSortedList

SearchTwoSortedList
Give a divide and conquer algorithm for the following problem: you are given two sorted lists of size m and n, and are allowed unit time access to the ith element of each list. Give an O(lg m + lgn) time algorithm for computing the kth largest element in the union of the two lists. (For simplicity, you can assume that the elements of the two lists are distinct).
MatrixChain

PriorityQueue
Matrix-chain product. The following are some instances.
a)	<3, 5, 2, 1,10>
b)	<2, 7, 3, 6, 10>
c)	<10, 3, 15, 12, 7, 2>
d)	<7, 2, 4, 15, 20, 5>
LongestCommonSubsequence

PriorityQueue
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS). The following are some instances.
a)	X: xzyzzyx Y: zxyyzxz
b)	X:MAEEEVAKLEKHLMLLRQEYVKLQKKLAETEKRCALLAAQANKESSSESFISRLLAIVAD
Y:MAEEEVAKLEKHLMLLRQEYVKLQKKLAETEKRCTLLAAQANKENSNESFISRLLAIVAG
LongestCommonSubstring

PriorityQueue
Longest Common Substring. The following are some instances.
a)	X: xzyzzyx Y: zxyyzxz
b)	X:MAEEEVAKLEKHLMLLRQEYVKLQKKLAETEKRCALLAAQANKESSSESFISRLLAIVAD
Y:MAEEEVAKLEKHLMLLRQEYVKLQKKLAETEKRCTLLAAQANKENSNESFISRLLAIVAG
MaxSum

PriorityQueue
Max Sum. The following is an instance.
a)	(-2，11，-4，13，-5，-2)
ShortestPath

PriorityQueue
Shortest path in multistage graphs. Find the shortest path from 0 to 15 for the following graph.
A multistage graph is a graph (1) G=(V,E) with V partitioned into K >= 2 disjoint subsets such that if (a,b) is in E, then a is in Vi , and b is in Vi+1 for some subsets in the partition; and (2) | V1 | = | VK | = 1.
